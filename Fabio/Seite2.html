            walking arte same timo reviev the singles? What next - the milkman dong the disco pages?

            THE COMMODORES: Midnight Magic (Tamla Motown). I say, I say, I say -- what's big in America, solid professional funk, but still faceless and only moderately entertaining mainly because of a distinct threadbareness in the melody department (excepting, of course, the traditional strong point of the smooth soul ballad)?
            Oh - you guessed. Best Trax:
            *Wonderland",
            "Sail On". (5 out
            of 10).
            PARLET: Invasion Of The Booty Snatchers (Caseblanca). Another spin-off from the Parliament/Funkadelic thang so beloved of Cliff White (late of this parish). Three long tracks per side, with the three giris wandering through the
            background of this lazy, spacey funk with their simple chants and refrains. I prefer a good tune myself, but this is still oddly captivating. Best trax: "Booty Snatchers",
            "No Rump To
            Bump". (5 out of 10).
            STARJETS: Stariets (Epic).
            Halfway between Stiff Little Fingers' urgency and The Undertones' simple poppiness come Ulster's Stariets.
            Potentially nifty tunes, but let down by directionless energy and toothless arrangements.
            Starjets really shine best when most adventurous, witness
            "Smart Boys", which certainly deserves to be No. 1. Useful start.
            Best trax: "Smart Boys". "I'm So Glad" (6 out of 10).</h6>

          <h6>SINCEROS: The Sound Of Sunbathing (Epic). Lene Lovich's former backing group strike out on their own with this collection of toe-tapping pop songs. Fun to listen to, but tha playing and arrangements are actually better than the songs themselves whicn tend to the forgettable, lacking punch and any real meat. Still, potential hit single merchants.
            Best trax: "Worlds Apart" "Good
            Luck To You". (5 out of 10)
            CHAS 'N' DAVE: Don't Give A Monkeys (Rockney/EMI). The gravel-throated thrushes spin their matey but monotonous cockney pub-rock out to an album, but how many re-writes of "Gertcha" (new version included here) do you need? One side is studio tracks, the other side live, and early copies include a free 4 track live EP of r'n'b standards. Best trax: "Rabbit",
            "Sideboard Song". (5 out of 10).</h6>

        <div class="column10">
          <h6>TARNEY-SPENCER BAND: Run For Your Life (A&M). Australian Alan Tarney wrote Cliff Richard's current hit (thrills, excitement) and this is pretty much in that vein. Mainstream pop-ballads with lots of oohs, aahs and a suspicion of country rock - quite nice but going nowhere slow.
            Disappointing after last year's punchy debut, but Olivia Neutron Bomb fans will love. Best trax:
            "Live Again", "Lies". (5 out of 10).
            MIKE OLDFIELD: Exposed (Virgin). Generously timed, a live orchestral double for the price of one. Contains "Incantations"
            "Tubular Bells" (largely
            revamped) and "Guilty". Not a lot else to say, except good bass from Pekka Pohjola (honest) on
            "Guilty" and nice singing from Maddy Prior on "Incantations"
            Oldfield par excellance - nice music to do something else by.
            Best trax: "Guilty".

            (Part 2)". (6 out of 10).</h6>
