          <h4>SALSATION!</h4>
          <h5> <p>YOU WOULDN'T honestly expec three geezers with names like Patrick, Chris and Alex to speak with French accents so thick you could slice 'em up and flog them as pate, now would ya? Well, that's the way it is with The Gibson Brothers, the hottest, sharpest and most refreshing thing to hit the disco scene all year.
            The three of them were born and brought up on the West Indian island of Martinique, a French speaking country of some 300,000 sun drenched souls.
            Their father being a musician, it wasn't surprising that from the age of ten they were playing the local dance music, a persuasive blend of Latin rhythm and soul strut known as "salsa"
            Ten years ago they moved their base of operations to Paris In order to pursue their higher education while looking for o break in the European scena.
            After playing everything from rhythm and blues to folk in the local clubs, they graduated to session work and finally set about making their own tracks, under the watchful eye of top French producer Daniel Vangarde.
            Success was not slow in coming. A single called "Come To America" hit big across the continent and was swiftly followed by "Non Stop Dancing and "Heaven", the three of them catching on quick in discos from Marseilles to Memphis.
            Britain has been slow to catch on. "Cuba", a dance record of unparalleled magnificence, brushed the bottom end of the charts a few months back though the follow up, "Oooh What A Life", Is doing a lot better.
            What's great about The Gibsons is the simple infectious happiness of their records, a welcome break from the automation and predictability of so much American disco. As Patrick, the brother on the drums, explains it, "It's because we come from The West Indies.
            The music doesn't sound
            American or British or French - it's just West Indian disco music, like the music we used to hear at the carnivals back in Martinique."
            Along with Alex, the keyboard man, and Chris, the lead vocalist, Patrick hopes to be back on these shores in October for a short stint of live dates, eight piece band and all!
