        <p>My first in-depth encounter with Alex Soth was through his latest publication, Songbook, which I reviewed when it came out last spring. As I delved into the background of the work, I became increasingly fascinated. What had started as a playful venture with a friend had become an important body of work, but more than that, it was the way in which it emerged that was intriguing.
            <br>Songbook began when Soth and writer Brad Zellar set out under the guise of working on a local newspaper reporting on small town communities. As the work progressed they went from a fictional newspaper to a real life one, published through Soth’s Little Brown Mushroom publishing house. Finally, in yet another form, the work became a book.
            <br>I met Alec Soth in late September as he was hanging his exhibition, Gathered Leaves, at Media Space in London. Bringing together a decade of work through four series, Sleeping by the Mississippi (2004), Niagara (2006), Broken Manual (2010) and Songbook(2015), the exhibition is an impressive account of the progression of an artist.
            <br> As we sat over coffee, while he took a break from the practicalities of exhibition hanging, we talked about his approach to photography and I asked him if he could tell me more.
