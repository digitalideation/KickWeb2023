    <h1>Exhibit D:</h1>
    <h2>Portfolio (1983)</h2>
    <h3>Directed by Robert Gurainick</h3>
    <p>
        This glossy documentary offers an idealised vision of life within the cut-throat modelling industry. Julie Wolfe, playing herself, 
        is fresh off the bus before starting work at Elite Models, jetting around the world and experiencing the glamour, 
        amusement and mild anxiety that comes from being a supermodel.<br><br>
        <b>In Portfolio, the makers are attempting to show the industry as being fun and enriching, but it actually comes 
        across as an outsider as being quite dull.</b><br>
        <b>EL:</b>That might be because being a model is incredibly boring.<br>
        <b>ML:</b> Ahahaha, come on?!<br>
        <b>EL:</b> It is!<br>
        <b>ML:</b> Portfolio is strange because it was produced by John Casablancas, the founder of 
        Elite (and the father of Julian Casablancas of The Strokes), so it presents a very positive
        image of the industry. Yet at the same time it is pretty accurate.<br>
        <b>EL:</b> It shows modelling as work. Boring work, where you’re just standing there looking nice, or difficult work, where you have to repeat the same thing over and over, look happy, etc. It’s work.<br>
        <b>ML:</b> But the models in the film understand that, so they just try to make time pass by chatting and being nice to one another. At one point, I was surprised that the director had kept in a scene where a model is shooting some lingerie outside and she says to the stylist, ‘What the hell am I wearing?!’ and then laughs. They don’t take it too seriously, and that’s how the biggest models roll.<br><br>
        
        <b>How typical was the heroine of Portfolio? She seems to represent the Hollywood dream chaser ideal?</b><br>
        <b>ML:</b> It may seem a bit too American-dream like, but for many models, that’s how it happens. You come from a small town where one person who seems to know about this industry tells you you have a chance to become a great model. You try it, you don’t know whether it’s a good idea, or if it will work, then you see that it’s just a job. The main character is very down to earth, but the problem with girls when they start out is that sometimes they get ideas. They think they're going to become actual princesses, and that can make for a lot of disappointment.<br><br>
        
        <b>Portfolio is the only film that presents modelling as pure, unalloyed fun.</b><br>
        <b>EL:</b> Lacking from this film is the sense of emptiness and sometimes loneliness you get, which is very much present in Gia.<br>
        <b>ML:</b> Yes, Portfolio makes it look like really fun work. And it says at some point, ‘all models are nice!’ which is obviously not true.Portfolio is the only film that presents modelling as pure,
