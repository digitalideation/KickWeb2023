                would be no Star
                Wars. In 1975 a
                young George
                Lucas was touting
                his idea for a space extravaganza
                around Hollywood. United Artists
                turned it down. Universal couldn’t
                grasp the idea. Men in suits used
                to counting bottom lines failed
                to connect with a universe of a
                myriad boggle-eyed creatures,
                rebellious galactic princesses and
                space-knights wielding pseudoreligious
                doctrine. Lucas needed
                someone to visualise his ideas…
                At the time Ralph was fresh
                from California’s Art Center
                College of Design and, after a
                stint at CBS creating paintings

                Barwood and Matthew Robbins
                on a movie pitch called Galactic.
                “There were furry blue aliens
                with lights on their chests, robots
                that climbed up the wall [and]
                a big vehicle they explored this
                planet with,” recalls Ralph when
                ImagineFX spoke to him in one of
                his last interviews before his death
                in 2012. “I really enjoyed the work. I
                felt like I was where I should be as
                an artist with these illustrations.”
                Although Galactic never reached
                the big screen, Hal and Matthew
                introduced Ralph to their friend
                George Lucas, who was struggling
                to get his intergalactic war film
                made. “It sounded like a neat
                idea, but I didn’t expect to ever
                hear from him again,” says Ralph,

                visualising key scenes in the scripts
                cannot be overestimated. As George
                Lucas put it, “When words could not
                convey my ideas, I could always point to
                one of Ralph’s fabulous illustrations and
                say, ‘Do it like this’.” He helped bring a
                galaxy to life – and to a cinema near you</h5>
