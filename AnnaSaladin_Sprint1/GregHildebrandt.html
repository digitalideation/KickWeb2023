                </div>ogether with his twin brother Tim,
                Greg Hildebrandt was commissioned
                in 1977 to paint the original Star Wars
                film poster. The work was produced for
                the Jon and Murray ad agency in New
                York, and the two 38-year-old artists
                were given just four days to paint the poster for a film
                nobody had yet seen or heard of…
                “They called us because of a Young Frankenstein
                painting that we did for them, in 24 hours, back in
                1974 for the Mel Brooks film, and the fame we’d gained
                thanks to our Lord of the Rings art,” Greg recalls.
                “We went in to the city and discussed the layout they
                wanted. They gave us some 8x10 photos from the film
                for reference. Then we went back to my studio and
                painted non-stop for 36 hours to deliver the job.”
                Could anyone have anticipated then that Star Wars
                would become so popular? “Of course not,” Greg
                replies. “No one did.” What’s more, he adds: “The ad
                agency that had the account had no idea what it was.
                When I asked what the movie was about, they said
                they had no idea, they had not seen it. They thought

            <h3>Vader was something like The Man in the Iron Mask.”
                Now, almost 40 years since that poster and 20 years
                since his last Star Wars illustration, Greg is painting
                Star Wars again. He’s been commissioned by Marvel to
                create three new paintings, one for each of the original
                films, for Omnibus Editions of the original comics.
                “When Marvel first contacted me, I was hesitant. I
                had not painted Star Wars since 1995. Twenty years
                is a long time. But as I began to work out sketches, it
                felt right. I thoroughly enjoyed jumping back into the
                Star Wars Universe. I tried to challenge myself with
                each piece and hopefully I succeeded in creating three
                paintings that the fans will like.
                “Each painting is its own challenge. I try for what
                I hope is the best composition and the best lighting
                setup I can come up with. Technical accuracy is
                important most of the time, [but] especially if it’s a
                subject like Star Wars. You have to make sure you
                paint the costumes and the ships as the fans know
                them, or else you look like an idiot. So of course I
                went out and bought models of the characters and
                the ships one more time. Thank God my son, Gregory,</h3>
