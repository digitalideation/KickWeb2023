                    Star Wars movie
                    burst onto cinema
                    screens almost 40
                    years ago, nobody
                    could have realised
                    just what an impact it and its
                    sequels would have on the lives
                    of so many people. At the heart
                    of the story are characters we
                    all fell in love with – but who are
                    they really? This is the question
                    the touring exhibition Star Wars
                    Identities aims to discover – and
                    along the way you can discover
                    your own true self. <br>
                    The exhibition, currently on
                    show in Cologne in Germany,
                    brings together unique art and
                    media from the Star Wars archives.
                    Some of it is commissioned for the
                    show, some of it original narrative
                    art from the Lucasfilm archives.
                    There are over 200 original props,
                    costumes and artworks from all
                    six Star Wars films. <br>
                    “Lucasfilm wanted it to be
                    educational and so after a lot of
                    thinking we came up with the idea
                    of exploring the characters, and
                </h3>

            <h3>that is how we ended up exploring
                the notion of identity,” explains
                communications director and
                museum liaison at X3 Productions
                Sophie Desbiens. “The exhibition
                basically asks: what makes you,
                you? We use – in parallel – the
                evolution of Luke Skywalker and
                Anakin (Darth Vader), who started
                off with similar origins and ended
                up quite differently.”
                The exhibition examines the
                evolution of the personalities
                of famous Star Wars characters
                through their stories. With the help
                of a scientific committee made up
                of specialists from neuro-sciences,
                psychology and genetics, the
                show organisers defined ten
                elements that compose someone’s
                identity and applied this to the
                characters of Star Wars. If you
                visit, you get the same treatment
                and have the opportunity to not
                only look at what makes you who
                you are but also to create your
                own Star Wars identity.
                The centrepiece of the show
                is a set of unique illustrations
                commissioned on the theme of</h3>

        <div class="column">
            <h4>"Let me tell you, the
                entire agency’s staff
                fought over who was
                going to get to work
                on this project!"</h4>
            <h3>Star Wars and identity. The
                creators of these stunning pieces,
                Jean-François LeBlanc, Sébastien
                Maheux and Louis Hébert, all
                work for the organisers’ ad
                agency Bleublancrouge. “Let me
                tell you,” confides Sophie, “the
                entire agency’s staff fought over
                who was going to get to work on
                that project!” <br>
                The idea of the exhibition is to
                explore what makes people who
                they are. The challenge for the
                artists was to render that concept
                visually. Each illustration explores
                what makes the character who he/
                she/it is, in a manner reminiscent
                of Arcimboldo’s famous portraits
                composed of fruit and vegetables.</h3>
