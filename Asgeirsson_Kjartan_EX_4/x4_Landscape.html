        <p><b>This section, as before, is going to take that same worldview of medieval fantasy that we have been working with, <br>
            and use this as a base to create a composition of a village with fields. The topic will require more expression than<br>
            previous topics that we have covered in this series so far. Let's get started.</b>

        <p>
            Before starting a drawing, I like to brainstorm the visual aspects. I want to express a scene that captures an element of the sky, <br>
            land buildings and vegetation. I'm thinking of taking a realistic modern design and mixing it with a little bit of fantasy to <br>
            represent the drawing. I think this will come out as a calm piece. The near distance and far distance, and th composition<br>
            between the two is goind to be our biggest task.
        </p>
        <p>
            As this image shows, I always start off simply. With a simple sketch I form the location of the buildings and the main <br>
            areas of sky and land. If you don't like the composition at this stage, start fixing the problem areas right away to your <br>
            liking. Modifications won't be a problem, since this is a simple sketch stage. The important factor is that you must be <br>
            satisfied with the sketch before moving on to the next step. If the artist themselves is unsure about their <br>
            own work, then no one else will be able to relate to the image.
