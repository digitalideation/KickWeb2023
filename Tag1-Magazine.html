            <p class="haupttext">
                There are two main types of whales – baleen
                and toothed. Baleen whales feed by filtering
                enormous amounts of water through their
                baleen, or plates of bristle-like keratin rather
                than teeth. <br>
                <br>
                Evolutionary scientists have been curious for
                years as to how the whales can eat without
                choking or drowning due to the large amounts
                of water that enter their mouths.<br>
                <br>
                These whales lunge-feed, so the force of
                water entering into their mouths via baleen
                is very powerful.<br>
                <br>
                While dissecting fin whales (attained from
                an Icelandic whaling station), researchers
                found a fascinating feature that allows
                these whales to eat without choking –
                an oral plug, like a trapdoor, far back in
                their mouths that blocks the route into
                the respiratory and digestive systems.<br>
                <br>
                This plug is controlled by muscles that work
                together to allow for breathing and swallowing
                at the correct times. These whales also have
                the ability to move and close off the larynx.<br>
                <br>
                These two features are complex in the design
                of these whales using both passive and
                active muscles for sealing off certain parts
                and allowing other parts to open for the right
                timing of pushing food or air along.<br>

            <p class="haupttext">Why are secularists so surprised that these
                whales would have these special features?
                They see these features as adaptations that
                allowed evolution of marine animals from
                past land animals. <br>
                <br>
                But adaptation does not equal Darwinian
                evolution (or Universal Common Descent).
                Adaptation is a God-given ability that allows
                animals to thrive in their environments.<br>
                <br>
                We aren’t surprised that our Creator would
                create these amazing whales with special
                features for breathing and swallowing, while
                eating and swimming, from the beginning.<br>
                <br>
                On day five of creation, God created ocean
                life, including whales. In their DNA, He gave
                them any codes needed to best function as
                whales, never changing from or into another
                animal.<br>
