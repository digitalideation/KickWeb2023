				<h2>How to pick <br> and store</h2>
	            <p>
					You'll find clementines from October through February. Choose
				    fruits that are intact and firm,
					heavy for their size, and deeply
					colored. But don't avoid fruits that
					have a slight green cast-they'll
					color quickly. Stored at room temperature
					with good air circulation,
					clementines keep several days to
					a week. Turning them and, even
					more important, keeping a little
					space between fruits, helps prevent
					mold from setting in. For
					longer keeping, stash them in the
					crisper drawer of the refrigerator.

					I like all kinds of fruit, but when it comes to citrus, c1ementines are-well, yes-my d arlings . These diminutive fruits have a thin skin that peels off easily, making them
					ideal for a quick mid-afternoon
					snack. I love their juicy, sweet flesh,
					which is just a little more acidic than
					that of oranges, and their wonderful
					floral scent. <br>
					By most accounts, c1ementines
					are the result of a cross between a
					mandarin and an orange that occurred
					at the beginning of the 20th
					century in the Algerian garden of a
					French missionary, Clement Rodier.
					Virtually unknown in this country
					25 years ago, c1ementines are now
					the most popular mandarin-type
					citrus on the market. Much of the
					world production is concentrated in
					Spain and Morocco ( South Africa
					and Israel are also big producers ) ,
					but more and more citrus farms in
					California are being converted from
					oranges to c1ementines. Most of the

				c1ementines available in the United
				States are rather small, but larger
				varieties exist.<br>

				<h2>Use the whole fruit</h2>

			<p>
				Although snacking on ripe clementines
				dripping with juice is one of
				the best things winter can offer, this
				fruit is wonderful in recipes, too. AI;
				with other citrus, the flesh, the juice,
				and the zest can all contribute their
				delicious perfumed flavor to a dish. <br>

				I use the zest and juice in sauces
				for meat or fish and in braises. Or I use
				them to make refreshing clementine
				sorbets or granitas (see the recipe at
				right) . A little zest gives a tantalizing
				flavor to vinaigrettes , homemade
				garlic mayonnaise, and marinades
				for meat, and it adds zing to a boring
				bowl of supermarket olives. <br>

				Sectioned or sliced clementines
				are a fresh addition to winter salads.
				They are also lovely poached, used
				as a tart topping, or in a compote.
