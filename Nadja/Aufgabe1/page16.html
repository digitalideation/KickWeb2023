    <div class="text1">You came to the West to make your fortune but so far it
      <br>has been an endless cycle of card playing, drinking
      <br>whisky, eating beans and shooting the numerous people
      <br>who said you smelled.
      <br>However, your luck is about to change. It is rumoured
      <br>that a cache of gold coins is hidden somewhere in Indian
      <br>territory and the treasure is there for the taking - well
      <br>almost! Just don't let the stories about the man-eating
      <br>vultures and the terrors of the desert deter you. Okay, it
      <br>could seriously damage your health but what kind of
      <br>cowboy are you - lily livered? No, of course not! So, plug
      <br>a joystick into port 1, get your spurs on and ride into the
      <br>West.
      <br>Oh! Silly me! I forgot. You can't afford a horse yet, can
      <br>you? How about a sponsored walk?

    <div class="playing">PLAYING THE GAME</div>
    <div class="text2">Use the joystick to move the cowboy. To open doors, kill
      <br>vultures etc. touch them whilst holding the correct object.
      <br>To pick up or drop objects position the cowboy appropri-
      <br>ately and press the joystick button.
      <br>Press the button to reincarnate after death, preserving
      <br>the current object positions. Your enemies will reincar-
      <br>nate as well though, so keep your weapons handy!
      <br>If you find yourself in an impossible postion press
      <br>START to begin again with the objects in their original
      <br>positions.
      <br>The game ends when you find the treasure. Press
      <br>START to play again.

    <div class="blackbox">TYPING IT IN</div>
    <div class="whitebox">Cassette and disk users should type in Listing 1, SAVE or
      CSAVE a copy, then RUN the program. The program will
      check each line of data and inform you of any errors. Correct
      any errors and RUN the program again until all errors are
      eliminated. When this is done answer the cassette/disk ques-
      tions accordingly to create a boot tape or binary disk file.
      Cassette users should load the boot tape created by fistly
      removing all cartridges and then turning on the computer
      while holding down the START key (XL and XE owners
      should hold down OPTION as well). Press RETURN and the
      tape will load an run automatically. <br>
      Disk users should clear Listing 1-from memory after saving
      and running it as above by tiping NEW and pressing RE-
      TURN. Next, type in Listing 2 and save it on the same disk
      as the binary file created by Listing 1. RUN the Listing 2
      program with the disk in the drive and the game will load and 
      run automatically.
