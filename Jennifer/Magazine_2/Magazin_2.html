        <b>B</b>efore her move into the director’s chair and headlining
        action spectaculars such as Tomb Raider, Wanted and
        alt, Angelina Jolie was out to show the world she was
        an serious actor. This HBO TV movie offers a biography of the
        woman thought to be the first supermodel, Gia Carangi, whose
        reliance on hard drugs also meant that she was also one of the
        first public figures to succumb to AIDS.<br><br>

        <b>LWLies: Gia offers a more compelling and – if feels – more
        redible version of the story told in Factory Girl. Is that
        the case?</b><br> 
        <b>ML:</b> Gia is really impressive in its accuracy.<br>
        <b>EL:</b>There’s a bit where she says, ‘The only thing you have to
        remember is that it’s not about you. It’s not you they’re looking
        at... I’m on top of that. I understand that. If you let it be about
        you, then you’re screwed. So... you have to stay separate from
        what’s happening, you have to be somewhere else.’ I wrote it all
        down because it’s perfect.<br><br>
        <b>ML:<b> She wanted money, and people told her she could be
        a model, so she tried it. At first it wasn’t too hard. It was fun.
        But, eventually, she realised that she was becoming famous for
        something she was not: she didn’t want to be a muse, she had
        a real personality and the fame made her feel lonely. Obviously
        I’ve never reached her level of fame, but the feeling of being seen
        as what you are not is there sometimes. People really think that
        telling you you are beautiful is all you need to hear, and although
        it’s nice, it becomes frustrating because you can’t complain about
        it. You also want to be seen as more than a pretty face.
        <b>EL:</b>I think Gia is an amazing movie because it gets that right,
        and she got that right. Instead of her downfall being linked to her
        not being successful anymore (like Sedgwick when Warhol lost

            interest in her), it was because she could not reconcile that fame,
            power, money and adulation with who she was.<br><br>
            What about that idea of having to play a role?<br>
            <b>EL:</bb> Yes, I think if you want to survive and not go crazy, you have
            to realise that it’s not about you. I don’t think I could do modelling
            full time because I could not feel fine about having only that,
            about the only goal being money. I could look further ahead to
            what I would do with that money in the future, but I’m just too
            impatient for that. Kudos to the models who deal with that.
            <b>ML:</b> The problem with this job is that it does not define you,
            even thought it’s all you do and it’s through this job that people
            see you and your success. It took me a while to really see it as
            just a job and not something that had to define me. I think that’s
            because modelling and fame are inextricably linked. For many,
            fame is the ultimate goal, so they assume you should be happy
            with just that.<br><br>
            <b>Do you ever see Gia-like, hyper volatile types who seem
            like they’re on the road to ruin?</b><br>
            <b>EL:</b> There are a few Gia-like models, I guess, but I usually feel like
            it’s because they’re just starting out. There are many, many more
            models who are perfectly level headed, hyper professional, and
            who have interesting lives going for them. It’s quite fascinating
            actually.<br>
            <b>ML:</b> I honestly think that Gia’s approach to the job was at first
            the best one to have: she really didn’t take it seriously. Problems
            started for her when she wanted more and people weren’t able
            to understand that. So she reached for drugs. I don't think her
            being volatile was the main reason for her demise, which makes
            this a very tragic story.
