            A Thoughtful Father
Eleven-year-old Wilbur and seven-year-old
Orville waited eagerly for their father to
come home from his business trip.
The year was 1878 and the reason for the
brothers’ excitement was that their father
always brought home presents.
This time was no exception. When he
dismounted his horse and reached in
his saddlebag, he brought out a strangelooking
toy.  <br>
<br>
It was about a foot tall and had a shaft
through it with a propeller on the top.
Toward the bottom was a rubber band to
power the propeller. Father instructed the
attentive boys to watch closely as he wound
        </div>

            up the propeller with his finger tightening
up the rubber band. As he released the
propeller, it rose eight feet in the air.
The brothers were shocked; they had never
seen anything like it before. Wilbur and
Orville thanked their father, but after three
days of constant use, the toy broke.
“Let’s build one ourselves,” exclaimed Wilbur.
“Sounds great,” agreed Orville, “How do we
do it?”<br>
<br>
“Well,” Wilbur said thoughtfully, “We will
have to make it twice as big.”
After several days of work, they were able
to build a duplicate toy twice as big.
